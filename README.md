# fantastic-octo-barnacle

This repository contains code written during following a tutorial "Your first 2D game". The name of the repo was randomly generated by GitHub.

Tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

The core mechanic of the game in the tutorial is that a player needs to "dodge creeps" for as long as possible. To make it a challenge, the author of this repo decided to change the mission to eat as many enemies as possible.
